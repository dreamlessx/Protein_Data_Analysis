# Protein_Data_Analysis
Benchmarked AlphaFold and Boltz-1 against X-ray structures across 20 protein complexes (6,761 structures). Validated with MolProbity/wwPDB metrics and custom Protein Busters suite. Evaluated 6 Rosetta relaxation protocols. Boltz excels in backbone geometry; AlphaFold leads in composite quality; relaxation improves all.
